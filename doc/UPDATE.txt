# Update from a Version <= 1.1.0
--------------------------------

There was a small database change, wich came with version 1.1.1 If you have a version of YAG smaller than 1.1.1 you have to do the following steps to upgrade:

1. BACKUP ALL YAG_* DATABASE TABLES
2. Install the update
3. Hit the "make update" button to run the database update
4. execute the following query on your database:

UPDATE tx_yag_domain_model_album a SET a.gallery = (SELECT m.uid_local FROM tx_yag_gallery_album_mm m WHERE m.uid_foreign = a.uid LIMIT 1)

Thats all.
